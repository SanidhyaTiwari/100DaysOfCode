# Repository Description for 100DaysOfCode
Overview
Welcome to my GitHub repository where I embark on a coding journey, tackling the Problem of the Day (POTD) from Geeks for Geeks (GFG) and diving into various other practice questions. This repository is my commitment to daily coding practice and improvement, predominantly using Python.

What's Inside?
Daily Updates: Each day, I solve the POTD presented by GFG, pushing my solutions here for reference and sharing. The repository serves as a log of my daily coding practice.
Practice Questions: Beyond the POTD, I explore a range of other coding problems to sharpen my skills, expand my knowledge, and challenge myself with different levels of difficulty.
Python Focus: My primary language for solving these challenges is Python. You'll find well-commented, clean, and efficient code snippets, showcasing various Pythonic ways to approach and solve problems.
Goals
Consistency: By committing to solve problems daily, I aim to build a consistent coding habit, enhancing my problem-solving skills and coding proficiency.
Learning: Each problem presents an opportunity to learn something new or refine existing skills. This repository is a testament to continuous learning and growth in the field of coding.
Community Contribution: By sharing my solutions, I hope to assist others in their learning journey, providing insights, alternate solutions, and sparking discussions around various coding challenges.
